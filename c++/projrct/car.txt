The program above is a car rental management system written in C++. Here are the key concepts and features used in the program:


---

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

a. Classes and Objects:

Car Class: Represents a basic car in the system with attributes like id, model, dailyRate, isAvailable, and methods like rentCar(), returnCar(), and display().

MaintainedCar Class: Inherits from Car, adds maintenance-specific attributes (lastServiceDate and mileage), and overrides the display() method.


b. Inheritance:

MaintainedCar is a derived class of Car. It reuses and extends the functionality of the base class.


c. Polymorphism:

Method Overriding: The display() method is overridden in the MaintainedCar class.

Dynamic Casting: The dynamic_cast operator checks whether an object is of a specific derived type.


d. Encapsulation:

Member variables are protected/private, accessed through public getter and setter methods.



---

2. File I/O:

Save Data: The saveData() function writes car data (regular and maintained cars) to a file (cars_data.txt).

Load Data: The loadData() function reads data from the file and reconstructs the car objects.



---

3. Runtime Polymorphism:

Use of base class pointers (Car *) to store objects of both Car and MaintainedCar.



---

4. User Interaction:

A menu-driven interface lets users:

1. Add cars (regular or maintained).


2. View all cars.


3. Rent a car.


4. Return a car.


5. Search for a car by ID.


6. Check availability.


7. View maintenance info.


8. Update maintenance info.





---

5. Dynamic Memory Management:

Cars are stored in a dynamic array (Car *cars[]), and memory is allocated using new and freed using delete.



---

6. Time Management:

Uses time_t and std::time to track rental and return times and calculate costs based on rental duration.



---

7. Data Structures:

Array of Pointers: The system uses an array of Car pointers (Car *cars[]) to manage multiple car objects.



---

8. Standard Library Usage:

<string>: For handling strings like car models, service dates, etc.

<fstream>: For file operations (saving/loading data).

<ctime>: For time-related operations.

<sstream>: To parse strings while loading data from the file.



---

9. Input Validation and Error Handling:

The program checks for invalid IDs when renting or returning cars.

Validates whether a car is maintained or regular during addition.



---

10. Abstraction:

General car functionality is encapsulated in the Car class, while specific features (like maintenance) are abstracted into the MaintainedCar class.



---

Key Features in Functionality:

1. Rental Process: Tracks car availability and rental duration.


2. Cost Calculation: Calculates rental cost based on hours and a derived hourly rate.


3. Maintenance Management: Allows updating and viewing maintenance details for maintained cars.


4. Persistence: Saves and loads car data to/from a file for continuity.



This program demonstrates how to design a real-world system using OOP principles and efficient data management techniques.
